### \### About the benchmark

This benchmark, created by Parallel, blends WISER-Fresh and WISER-Atomic. WISER-Fresh is a set of 76 queries requiring the freshest data from the web, generated by Parallel with o3 pro. WISER-Atomic is a set of 120 hard real-world business queries, based on use cases from Parallel customers. Read our blog [here](https://parallel.ai/blog/search-api-benchmark) [here]($https://parallel.ai/blog/search-api-benchmark) .

### \### Distribution

60% WISER-Atomic

### \### Evaluation

The Parallel Search API was evaluated by comparing three different web search solutions (Parallel MCP server, Exa MCP server/tool calling, LLM native web search) across four different LLMs (GPT 4.1, o4-mini, o3, Claude Sonnet 4).
