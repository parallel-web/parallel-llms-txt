On the expiration or termination of the Agreement, the receiving Party shall promptly return to the disclosing Party all copies, whether in written, electronic, or other form or media, of the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, or destroy all such copies and certify in writing to the disclosing Party that such Confidential Information has been destroyed. Each Party’s confidentiality obligations with regard to Confidential Information are effective as of the Effective Date and will expire five years from the date first disclosed to the receiving Party; provided, however, with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret (as determined under applicable law), such obligations of non-disclosure will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for as long as such Confidential Information remains subject to trade secret protection under applicable law.

Accordingly, if Customer is an agency of the US Government or any contractor therefor, Customer only receives those rights with respect to the Services and Documentation as are granted to all other end users, in accordance with (a) 48 C.F.R. § 227.7201 through 48 C.F.R. § 227.7204, with respect to the Department of Defense and their contractors, or (b) 48 C.F.R. § 12.212, with respect to all other US Government users and their contractors.

(j) Equitable Relief. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that a breach or threatened breach by such Party of any of its obligations under Section 7 or, in the case of Customer, Section 2(d), would cause the other Party irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and agrees that, in the event of such breach or threatened breach, the other Party will be entitled to equitable relief, including a restraining order, an injunction, specific performance and any other relief that may be available from any court, without any requirement to post a bond or other security, or to prove actual damages or that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy. Such remedies are not exclusive and are in addition to all other remedies that may be available at law, in equity or otherwise.

(k) Publicity. Parallel is permitted to disclose that Customer is one of its customers to any third-party at its sole discretion. Customer agrees that Parallel may use Customer’s name and logo to refer to Customer as a customer of Parallel on its website and in marketing materials. Subject to Customer’s prior approval, Customer will participate in press announcements, case studies, trade shows, or other marketing activities at-will when reasonably requested by Parallel.

(l) Amendments. Parallel may amend the terms and conditions of Agreement from time to time, in which case the new Agreement will supersede prior versions. Parallel will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide advance notice to Customer of any material amendment. If Customer does not agree to any amendment, Customer may opt out of the automatic renewal prior to the expiration of the then-current subscription term under Orders Forms entered into prior to such amendment, which will continue to be subject to the prior version of this Agreement (without such amendment). Customer’s continued use of the Services following the effective date of any such amendment constitute Customer’s agreement to any such amendment. Any Online Order(s) executed after the effective date of an amendment shall constitute Customer’s agreement to any such amendment. Parallel’s acceptance of any document submitted by Customer to Parallel shall not be construed as an acceptance of provisions which are in any way in conflict or inconsistent with, or in addition to, this Agreement, unless such terms are separately and specifically accepted in writing by an authorized representative of Parallel.
