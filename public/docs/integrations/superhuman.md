# Superhuman

> Use Parallel with Superhuman

Integrate Parallel's AI-powered web intelligence with Superhuman to bring real-time web data
into your writing.

## Installation

* Search for Parallel on the Superhuman agent store and install.
* Or install the agent integration directly [here](https://superhuman.com/store/agents/parallel-web-intelligence-45397).

## Available Skills

* **Verify claims and suggest modifications**: verify any claims made in your writing and have the agent suggest modifications
  inplace.
* **Generate citations**: for any text, ask the agent to generate citations that you can use to establish
  authenticity and provenance
* **Write or extend a report**: for any topic or a partial report, ask the agent to write a report or if the report is already
  partially complete, complete it

## Tips

* Keep the context small and verify claims as you go instead of verifying claims for a long text at once.
* Ask the agent to verify claims to trigger the claim verification skill
* To get the agent to generate citations, ask it to generate citations in the Superhuman chat box.
