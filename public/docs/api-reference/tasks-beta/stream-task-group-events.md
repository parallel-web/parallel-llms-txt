      The Task API executes web research and extraction tasks. Clients submit a
      natural-language objective with an optional input schema; the service
      plans retrieval, fetches relevant URLs, and returns outputs that conform
      to a provided or inferred JSON schema. Supports deep research style
      queries and can return rich structured JSON outputs. Processors trade-off
      between cost, latency, and quality. Each processor supports calibrated
      confidences.

      - Output metadata: citations, excerpts, reasoning, and confidence per
      field
  - name: Tasks (Beta)
    description: >-
      The Task Group API is currently in beta and enables batch execution of
      many independent Task runs with group-level monitoring and failure
      handling.

      - Submit hundreds or thousands of Tasks as a single group

      - Observe group progress and receive results as they complete

      - Real-time updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE)

      - Add tasks to an existing group while it is running

      - Group-level retry and error aggregation

      Status: beta and subject to change.
  - name: Search (Beta)
    description: >-
      Search returns ranked URLs with extended excerpts suitable for LLM
      consumption. Inputs are a natural-language objective and optional keyword
      queries. Source policies allow including or excluding specific domains and
      have configurable output sizes. The returned extended snippets contain
      dense, relevant information from relevant pages.

      - Result: ranked list with URL, title, and long text excerpts
  - name: Extract (Beta)
    description: >-
      Extract returns excerpts or full content from one or more URLs. Inputs are
      a list of URLs and an optional search objective and keyword queries. The
      returned excerpts or full content is formatted as markdown and suitable
      for LLM consumption.

      - Result: excerpts or full content from the URL formatted as markdown
  - name: FindAll API (Beta)
    description: >-
      The FindAll API discovers and evaluates entities that match complex
      criteria from natural language objectives. Submit a high-level goal and
      the service automatically generates structured match conditions, discovers
      relevant candidates, and evaluates each against the criteria. Returns
      comprehensive results with detailed reasoning, citations, and confidence
      scores for each match decision. Streaming events and webhooks are
      supported.
  - name: Chat API (Beta)
    description: >-
      The Chat API provides a programmatic chat-style text generation interface.
      It accepts a sequence of messages and returns model responses. Intended
      for assistant-like interactions and evaluation. Streaming responses are
      supported.
