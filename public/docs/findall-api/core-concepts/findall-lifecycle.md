# Run Lifecycle

> Understand FindAll run statuses, termination reasons, and how to cancel runs

## Run Statuses and Termination Reasons

FindAll runs progress from `queued` → `running` → terminal state (`completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`).
A run is considered **active** when it has status `queued`, `running` and has active candidate generation, evaluation, and enrichments ongoing.

### Status Definitions

| Status      | Description                                  | Can Extend? | Can Enrich? |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `queued`    | Run is waiting to start processing           | N/A         | N/A         |
| `running`   | Run is actively evaluating candidates        | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes       |
| `completed` | Run finished (see termination reasons below) | Depends\*   | ✅ Yes       |
| `failed`    | Run encountered an error                     | ❌ No        | ❌ No        |
| `cancelled` | Run was cancelled by user                    | ❌ No        | ❌ No        |

\* See termination reasons below for extendability

### Termination Reasons

When a run reaches a terminal state, it will have one of these termination reasons:

| Termination Reason     | Description                                        | Can Extend?                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `match_limit_met`      | Successfully found the requested number of matches | ✅ Yes                                |
| `low_match_rate`       | Match rate too low to continue efficiently         | ❌ No - try a more powerful generator |
| `candidates_exhausted` | All available candidates have been processed       | ❌ No - broaden query                 |
| `error_occurred`       | Run encountered an error and cannot be continued   | ❌ No                                 |
| `timeout`              | Run timed out and cannot be continued              | ❌ No                                 |
| `user_cancelled`       | Run was cancelled by the user                      | ❌ No                                 |
