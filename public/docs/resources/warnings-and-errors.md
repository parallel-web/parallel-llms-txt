# Warnings and Errors

> Breakdown of warnings and errors

The Task API may return various warnings and errors during operation. This page documents the possible error types you might encounter when using the API.

## Errors

Errors result in a failure to process your request and are returned with appropriate HTTP status codes (4xx or 5xx).

| Error                          | Description                                                                                 | Resolution                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Invalid JSON Schema**        | The JSON schema provided in the task spec for input or output is invalid.                   | Review your schema against JSON Schema specifications and ensure it follows the required format.      |
| **Task Spec + Input Too Long** | The combined task specification and input exceeds 18,000 characters.                        | Reduce the size of your task spec or input data. Consider splitting into multiple tasks if necessary. |
| **Too-Complex Output Schema**  | The output schema exceeds allowed complexity in terms of nesting depth or number of fields. | Simplify your output schema by reducing nested levels to 3 or less.                                   |

## Warnings

Warnings indicate potential issues that don't prevent the request from being processed but may affect results.

| Warning                               | Description                                                            | Resolution                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Input Fails Validation**            | The provided input does not conform to the input schema.               | Verify your input against the schema requirements and make necessary adjustments. |
| **Task Spec + Input Over Size Limit** | The combined task specification and input exceeds the character limit. | Consider optimizing your input or task spec for better performance.               |
| **Too Many Output Fields**            | The number of requested output fields exceeds the recommended limit.   | Consider reducing the number of output fields.                                    |

## Warning Handling

The Task API uses a warning system to provide guidance without blocking execution. Warnings are generated during validation and can be handled in two ways:

### Basis Properties

It is recommended to use `FieldBasis` in the run output rather than requesting similar information in the output schema.

This means you've included fields like `citations`, `reasoning`, or `sources` in your output schema, but this information is **already provided automatically** in every Task Run result through the [Basis](/task-api/guides/access-research-basis) feature.

**What is Basis?** Every Task Run result includes a `basis` array containing citations, reasoning, and confidence levels for each output field. This is provided automatically; you don't need to request it in your schema.

**Why not include these in the output schema?**

* **Redundant**: You'll get duplicate data, wasting tokens and processing
* **Less structured**: The automatic Basis provides properly structured citations with URLs and excerpts
* **Less reliable**: Asking the model to generate its own citations may produce less accurate results than the built-in citation tracking

The following field names trigger this warning:

* `citations`
* `confidence`
* `evidence`
* `reasoning`
* `source`
* `sources`
* `source_urls`

**Instead of this:**

```json  theme={"system"}
{
  "properties": {
    "company_name": { "type": "string" },
    "reasoning": { "type": "string" },
    "sources": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } }
  }
}
```

**Do this:**

```json  theme={"system"}
{
  "properties": {
    "company_name": { "type": "string" }
  }
}
```

Then access `output.basis` in the response to get citations, reasoning, and confidence for each field. See [Accessing Research Basis](/task-api/guides/access-research-basis) for details.

## Error Response Format

All errors return a consistent JSON structure:

```json  theme={"system"}
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Human-readable error description",
    "detail": {
      // Additional error-specific information
    }
  }
}
```

For validation errors (422), the `detail` field contains specific information about which fields failed validation and why.

## 402 Payment Required Troubleshooting

A 402 error indicates your account has insufficient credits to process the request. This can occur even if your account shows a positive balance due to **in-flight balance reservations**.

### Understanding In-Flight Balance

When you submit a task, the system reserves credits for the estimated cost before processing begins. This reservation is called the "in-flight balance." Your **available balance** equals your **total balance** minus the **in-flight balance** from all currently running tasks.

**Example scenario:**

* Account balance: \$10.00
* 5 running `pro` tasks (each reserves \~$0.10): $0.50 reserved
* Available balance: \$9.50

If your available balance is insufficient for a new task, you'll receive a 402 error even though your total balance appears positive.

### Common Causes

| Cause                            | Solution                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Multiple concurrent tasks**    | Running many tasks simultaneously reserves credits for each. Wait for some to complete or reduce concurrency.                         |
| **Higher-tier processors**       | `ultra` and `pro` processors reserve more credits than `base` or `lite`. Consider using lower-tier processors for less complex tasks. |
| **Insufficient account balance** | Add credits at [platform.parallel.ai](https://platform.parallel.ai).                                                                  |
| **Large task groups**            | Task groups reserve credits for all runs upfront. Split into smaller batches if needed.                                               |

### How to Resolve

1. **Check your balance**: View your current balance and usage at [platform.parallel.ai](https://platform.parallel.ai)
2. **Wait for tasks to complete**: In-flight reservations are released when tasks finish
3. **Add credits**: Top up your account balance if genuinely low
4. **Reduce concurrency**: Lower the number of parallel tasks to reduce reserved credits
5. **Use lower-tier processors**: Reserve fewer credits per task by using `base` or `lite` processors where appropriate

<Tip>
  For high-volume workloads, monitor your available balance (not just total balance) and implement backoff logic when approaching limits. See [Pricing](https://parallel.ai/pricing) for processor costs.
