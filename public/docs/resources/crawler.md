# Crawler

> This documentation provides guidance for webmasters on managing their website's interaction with our crawling system

## ShapBot

ShapBot helps discover and index websites for Parallel's web APIs. To maximize your site's visibility in search results, we suggest allowing ShapBot access in your robots.txt configuration and permitting connections from our designated IP ranges.

Full user-agent string: Mozilla/5.0 AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko); compatible; ShapBot/0.1.0

For the complete list of ShapBot IPs, see [shapbot.json](https://docs.parallel.ai/resources/shapbot.json).
