# Quickstart

> Start building web-based enrichment flows with Parallel Tasks

## What is a Task?

A Task is a defined web research query with structured inputs and outputs. Any information retrieval that can be done on the open web is in scope for the Task API.

Examples include programmatic CRM enrichment, compliance checks for insurance underwriting, and financial opportunity research.

## 1. Set up Prerequisites

Generate your API key on [Platform](https://platform.parallel.ai). Then, set up with the TypeScript SDK, Python SDK or with cURL:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL theme={"system"}
  echo "Install curl and jq via brew, apt, or your favorite package manager"
  export PARALLEL_API_KEY="PARALLEL_API_KEY"
  ```

  ```bash TypeScript theme={"system"}
  npm install parallel-web
  export PARALLEL_API_KEY="PARALLEL_API_KEY"
  ```

  ```bash Python theme={"system"}
  pip install parallel-web
  export PARALLEL_API_KEY="PARALLEL_API_KEY"
  ```

  ```bash Python (Async) theme={"system"}
  pip install parallel-web
  export PARALLEL_API_KEY="PARALLEL_API_KEY"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## 2. Execute your First Task Run

Make your first API request with one of these examples:

  ```bash cURL theme={"system"}
  echo "Creating the run:"
  RUN_JSON=$(curl -s "https://api.parallel.ai/v1/tasks/runs" \

      },
      "input": "United Nations",
      "processor": "base"
  }')
  echo "$RUN_JSON" | jq .
  RUN_ID=$(echo "$RUN_JSON" | jq -r '.run_id')

  echo "Retrieving the run result, blocking until the result is available:"
  curl -s "https://api.parallel.ai/v1/tasks/runs/${RUN_ID}/result" \
    -H "x-api-key: ${PARALLEL_API_KEY}" | jq .

  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript theme={"system"}

  let runResult;
  for (let i = 0; i < 144; i++) {
    try {
      runResult = await client.taskRun.result(taskRun.run_id, { timeout: 25 });
      break;
    } catch (error) {
      if (i === 143) throw error; // Last attempt failed
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    }
  }

  console.log(runResult.output);
  ```

  ```python Python theme={"system"}

  from parallel import Parallel
  from parallel.types import TaskSpecParam

  client = Parallel(api_key=os.environ["PARALLEL_API_KEY"])

  run_result = client.task_run.result(task_run.run_id, api_timeout=3600)
  print(run_result.output)
  ```

  ```python Python (Async) theme={"system"}

      return run_result

  run_result = asyncio.run(run_task())
  print(run_result.output)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Sample Response

Immediately after a Task Run is created, the Task Run object, including the status of the Task Run, is returned. On completion, the Task Run Result object is returned.

[Basis](/task-api/guides/access-research-basis), including citations, reasoning, confidence, and excerpts - is returned with every Task Run Result.

## 3. From Simple to Complex Tasks

The Task API supports a progression of task complexity:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Simple Query -> Simple Answer">
    Simply ask "What was the founding date of the United Nations?" and receive an answer based on web research in plain text. This straightforward approach is illustrated above.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Simple Query -> Structured Output">
    Define a structured output format with founding date, employee count and other desired details for a company, passing in the company name as input.

To execute multiple Task Runs concurrently, we recommend using [Task Groups](/task-api/group-api).
