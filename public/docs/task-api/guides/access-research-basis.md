# Access Research Basis

> Understand how to access citations, reasoning, and confidence levels for your Task Run outputs

When you execute a task using the Task API, the response includes both the generated output and its corresponding research basisâ€”a structured explanation detailing the reasoning and evidence behind each result. This transparency enables you to understand how the system arrived at its conclusions and to assess the reliability of the output.

## Terminology

To avoid confusion, this document uses the following terminology:

* **Research Basis**: The overall feature that provides transparency into how Task API results are generated
* **Basis**: The `basis` field in the API response, which contains an array of field-specific evidence
* **FieldBasis**: The specific object type that contains citations, reasoning, and confidence for individual output fields

## Task Run Result

Every Task Run Result object contains the following fields:

| Field    | Type                         | Description                                                                                |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `run`    | object                       | Task Run object with status and id, detailed above.                                        |
| `output` | TaskRunOutput object or null | Output from the task conforming to the output schema. Present iff run.status == completed. |

A TaskRunOutput object can be one of two types:

* TaskRunTextOutput
* TaskRunJsonOutput

Both have the following fields:

| Field     | Type               | Description                                                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `content` | string             | JSON or plain text according to the output schema.                                             |
| `basis`   | array\[FieldBasis] | Array of FieldBasis objects, one for each top-level output field. See FieldBasis object below. |
| `type`    | string             | Always `text`                                                                                  |

## Research Basis Structure

The `basis` field contains an array of FieldBasis objects that correspond to each top-level field in your output. This allows you to trace exactly which sources on the web contributed to each specific piece of information in your result.

## The FieldBasis object

Each FieldBasis object has these components:

| Field        | Type             | Description                                             |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `field`      | string           | Name of the corresponding output field                  |
| `citations`  | array\[Citation] | List of web sources supporting the output field         |
| `reasoning`  | string           | Explanation of how the system processed the information |
| `confidence` | string or null   | Reliability rating for each output field                |

### Citations

Citations provide the exact URLs where information was found. Each citation includes excerpts from the source that contributed to the output:

| Field      | Type                   | Description                   |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `url`      | string                 | The source URL                |
| `excerpts` | array\[string] or null | Relevant text from the source |

Having multiple citations for an output field often indicates stronger evidence, as the information was verified across multiple sources.

### Reasoning

The reasoning field explains how the system evaluated, compared, and synthesized information from different sources. This is particularly valuable when:

* Information from different sources needed to be reconciled
* Calculations or conversions were performed
* The system needed to make judgments about conflicting data

### Confidence Levels

All processors include a confidence rating for each output field:

* **High**: Strong evidence from multiple authoritative sources with consistent information
* **Medium**: Adequate evidence but with some inconsistencies or from less authoritative sources
* **Low**: Limited or conflicting evidence, or information from less reliable sources

## Examples
