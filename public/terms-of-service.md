These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and PARALLEL WEB SYSTEMS INC. (“Parallel,” “we” and “us”). Your use of our websites in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use our websites. These Terms include the provisions in this document as well as those in the Privacy Policy.

Please read these Terms carefully. They cover important information about our website. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USE OF AND ACCESS TO OUR WEBSITES ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS OUR WEBSITES IN ANY MANNER.

## \## Will these Terms ever change?

We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with our Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will place a notice on our site located at parallel.ai, send you an email, and/or notify you by some other means.

If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.

Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.

## \## What about my privacy?
