### ### About the benchmark

This benchmark, created by Parallel, blends WISER-Fresh and WISER-Atomic. WISER-Fresh is a set of 76 queries requiring the freshest data from the web, generated by Parallel with o3 pro. WISER-Atomic is a set of 120 hard real-world business queries, based on use cases from Parallel customers. Read our blog [here](https://parallel.ai/blog/search-api-benchmark)[here]($https://parallel.ai/blog/search-api-benchmark).

### ### Distribution

40% WISER-Fresh  
60% WISER-Atomic

### ### Evaluation

The Parallel Search API was evaluated by comparing three different web search solutions (Parallel MCP server, Exa MCP server/tool calling, LLM native web search) across four different LLMs (GPT 4.1, o4-mini, o3, Claude Sonnet 4).

### ### About the benchmark

This [benchmark](https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench)[benchmark]($https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep\_research\_bench) contains 100 expert-level research tasks designed by domain specialists across 22 fields, primarily Science & Technology, Business & Finance, and Software Development. It evaluates AI systems' ability to produce rigorous, long-form research reports on complex topics requiring cross-disciplinary synthesis. Results are reported from the subset of 50 English-language tasks in the benchmark. Read the [blog](https://parallel.ai/blog/deep-research-benchmarks)[blog]($https://parallel.ai/blog/deep-research-benchmarks).

### ### Methodology

* - Dates: All measurements were made between 08/11/2025 and 08/29/2025.
* - Win Rate: Calculated by comparing [RACE](https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench)[RACE]($https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep\_research\_bench) scores in direct head-to-head evaluations against reference reports.
* - Configurations: For all competitors, we report results for the highest numbers we were able to achieve across multiple configurations of their APIs. The exact GPT-5 configuration is high reasoning, high search context, and high verbosity.
* - Excluded API Results: Exa Research Pro (0% win rate), Claude Opus 4.1 (0% win rate).
