# \# THE WEB'S SECOND USER, AUGUST 14 2025

1\.

The open web is a miracle. Anyone can publish, learn, and collaborate. It’s the closest thing to humanity’s living memory. This open ecosystem fueled today’s AI breakthroughs.

2\.

And it’s about to face its biggest challenge yet: the primary user is shifting from humans to AIs. Soon, AIs will use the web far more than humans ever have.

3\.

Human web use is narrow: clicks, scrolls, short searches as inputs; a few pages at a time, all served in seconds. AIs vary widely: instant responses or hours of processing, single facts or entire databases.

4\.

Business models built on human attention can’t serve AIs. By default, the web trends toward zero-sum: paywalls, gated APIs, and private data silos everywhere, undermining the very miracle that sparked the AI revolution.

5\.

We need to build a new Programmatic Web specifically for AIs: declarative, composable layers built around reasoning and computation, verifiable provenance, and open markets.

6\.

**Unified data, compute, reasoning.** Engineered to operate as one so that outputs are actions and insights, not just documents.

7\.

**Declarative interfaces.** Designed so AIs state what they need, not how to get it. The infrastructure determines how. Pull turns to push.

8\.

**Transparent attribution.** Built so every source and insight is tracked and credited. Contributions become measurable and transparent.

9\.

Open, value-based markets. Incentivized so participants earn based on value they add. Staying open wins, not due to virtue, but because it’s economically superior.

10\.

This isn't about preserving the old web. It's about unlocking what comes next: AIs solving complex problems, accelerating discovery, creating things we can't yet imagine.

11\.

The choice is binary: we build the open web for its second user, or it fractures beyond repair. At Parallel, we are building for abundance.
